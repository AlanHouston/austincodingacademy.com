&lt;p&gt;“Everybody deserves access to a technical education and an opportunity to benefit from Austin’s booming tech industry,” says Austin Coding Academy CEO, Chris Lofton. “We’re excited to partner with Lyft to provide their drivers with this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin Coding Academy (ACA) will provide a discount to all current Lyft drivers who are interested in launching a career in technology. Currently, ACA offers tracks in Javascript, C#/.NET, and UI/UX and each track consists of three courses. Lyft drivers will be eligible for $225 off a single course or $675 off the total track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tapping into a growing, but at times exclusive, tech scene, ACA is constantly looking for opportunities to foster inclusivity and diversity in tech through key program features such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part-time courses aimed at allowing working adults to continue to support themselves while making a meaningful career change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most affordable full stack web development tuition in Austin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A curriculum that is researched, designed, and taught by local, full-time industry professionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving accessibility to drivers who have already demonstrated a commitment to using their spare time to better support themselves represents another step towards promoting diversity of experience and identity – and one that has already seen success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean Philippi has excelled as a student at ACA, where he’s on track to graduate as a full-stack Javascript developer in December of this year. As a Lyft driver and now an ACA student, Sean embodies the extra level of commitment necessary to thrive in a challenging environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I find the courses to be well-paced and challenging. I am very grateful for having discovered ACA.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Sean Philippi, Lyft driver &amp;amp; ACA student&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When self-teaching in the past, I’d often give up after being stuck for so long. I still get stuck now, but I have people that can help me get unstuck quickly, which is one of the most valuable parts of being in a classroom,” Sean says. “I find the courses to be well-paced and challenging. I am very grateful for having discovered ACA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACA is excited to provide Lyft drivers with the opportunity to develop skills and transition to higher-paying tech jobs. With part-time evening courses and the most affordable full-stack coding education in the area, Austin Coding Academy is committed to increasing local access to careers in tech. ACA graduates work at companies like Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, Verizon and many Austin Startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Glitch: Coding Made Easy” is a 2-hour workshop whose goal is to inspire teens to explore careers in computer programming. We are proud to partner with APL to introduce a creative an in-demand skill for their future careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the students began the night with no coding experience, but after 120 minutes, all were able to create and deploy their own websites on a topic they were interested in. “We covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,” said ACA’s CEO Chris Lofton, who instructed the class. “One student built her website about books and movies she loves. Another student’s website consisted of pictures from all the places she traveled. One even built a site that included instructions on how to play his favorite video game!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;![Teenage student builds website displaying places she’s traveled](https://blog.austincodingacademy.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_9845.jpg?width=595&amp;amp;name=IMG_9845.jpg =595x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course, students worked together to solve different problems they encountered while building their sites. Each of the students was fully engaged through the process of brainstorming, designing, and building their pages while getting feedback and guidance from their instructor. By the end of the night, they each had an active website to take home and continue building on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We could not be any happier with the event,” said APL Youth Technology Librarian Adrian Perez. “One particular student, Tori, attended the program we had the next night and told me that she always wanted to major in music, but after Glitch and joining a robotics club last month, she wants to go into coding as well – specifically music software. She proudly told us that she already knows what she wants to do with her life – and she’s only 13!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on Austin Public Library’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.austintexas.gov/events/calendar?loc=3939&quot;&gt;events calendar&lt;/a&gt; for more Austin Coding Academy library workshops coming down the pipeline. It is ACA’s core mission to make tech careers accessible to everyone, and we think giving teens exposure to the challenges and rewards of coding will illuminate this as a possible path they could take after high school. “We absolutely want to continue planning events with ACA in the future,” said Perez.&lt;/p&gt;
